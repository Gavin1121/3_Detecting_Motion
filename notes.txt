Kalman Filters
    - Based off motion between frames.
    - Only 2 frames considered, then the "motion" could be noise.

    - 2 differences can be evaluated
        - 1. Between the frames at "t" and "t-1"
        - 2. Between the frames at "t-1" and "t-2"
    -The detect motion frame will be the minimum of these 2 differences.

    - Easy way to filter noise is to set a threshold "T", which will be a hyperparameter:
        - If the pixel values in the motion frame are less than "T", they are set to 0
